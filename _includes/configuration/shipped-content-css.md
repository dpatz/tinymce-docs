{{site.productname}} comes with four content CSS:

- `default`
- `dark`
- `document`
- `writer`

These CSS can be added to the editor configuration using the `content_css` option. They can also be used as a template for creating a custom CSS for the editor. For the CSS source code, see: [{{site.productname}} GitHub Repository - Provided Content CSS](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/tree/develop/modules/oxide/src/less/skins/content).

{{site.companyname}} also provides content CSS with the premium skins, for a list of premium content CSS, see:
[{{site.prem_skins_icons}}]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/premium-skins-and-icon-packs/).

{{site.companyname}} recommends using the same CSS for both the editor and the page where the editor content will be rendered.
